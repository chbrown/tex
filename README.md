# tex

Currently this project only contains a lexer for BibTeX and very simple TeX stacks.

Right now it's Node.js-dependent, but I have plans for a pure version.

It's similar to [docx-tex](https://github.com/chbrown/docx-tex).

Open an issue, let me know what you want.



## Installation

**From npm:**

```sh
npm install tex
```

**Or github:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chbrown/tex.git
cd tex
npm install -g
```

**Import:**

```js
var tex = require('tex');
```
